# PROMPTS.md

This file documents the key prompts I used with AI assistants (like ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot) to help build this personal portfolio website. All code generated by AI has been modified, adapted, and integrated into this project to fit the specific requirements and design.

## Project Setup

### Prompt 1: Vue Router Setup
**Prompt:** "How do I set up Vue Router in a Vue 3 project with Vite? I need to create routes for Home, About, Skills, Links, Projects, and Blog pages. Projects and Blog should also have detail pages with dynamic routes using IDs."

**Modifications Made:**
- Created router configuration file at `src/router/index.js`
- Added all required routes with proper component imports
- Used dynamic routes for project and blog detail pages with `:id` parameter
- Integrated router into main.js using `createApp(App).use(router)`

### Prompt 2: Responsive Navigation Bar

### Prompt 3: Fetching JSON Data in Vue
**Prompt:** "How do I asynchronously fetch and display data from a local JSON file in a Vue 3 component using the Composition API? The JSON file is in the public folder."

**Modifications Made:**
- Used `fetch()` API to load JSON files from `/data/projects.json` and `/data/blog.json`
- Implemented loading and error states using reactive refs
- Used `onMounted` lifecycle hook to fetch data when components mount
- Added proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- Created reusable fetch functions in Projects.vue and Blog.vue components

### Prompt 4: Dynamic Routes with Parameters
**Prompt:** "How do I create dynamic routes in Vue Router that pass parameters, and how do I access those parameters in the component to fetch specific data?"

**Modifications Made:**
- Set up dynamic routes with `:id` parameter in router configuration
- Used `useRoute()` hook to access route parameters in components
- Implemented data filtering to find specific project/blog post by ID
- Added error handling for when project/blog post is not found
- Created navigation functions to go back to list pages

## Component Structure

### Prompt 5: Card-based Layout
**Prompt:** "Create a responsive card-based grid layout using CSS Grid that displays project cards. Each card should have hover effects and be clickable."

**Modifications Made:**
- Created Projects.vue with CSS Grid layout
- Added hover effects using CSS transitions
- Made cards clickable to navigate to detail pages
- Used `@click.stop` to prevent event bubbling on link clicks
- Implemented responsive design with `auto-fill` and `minmax()`

### Prompt 6: Blog Post Formatting
**Prompt:** "How do I convert markdown-style text content to HTML in Vue? I need to display blog post content with headings, bold text, and code blocks."

**Modifications Made:**
- Created `formatContent()` function to convert markdown to HTML
- Used regex to replace markdown syntax with HTML tags
- Added CSS styling for formatted content using `:deep()` selector

## Styling and Design

### Prompt 7: Gradient Backgrounds

- Applied gradients to navbar, buttons, and hero section
- Created consistent color scheme using CSS variables
- Added hover effects and transitions for interactive elements

### Prompt 8: Responsive Design Breakpoints
**Prompt:** "What are the best practices for responsive design breakpoints in CSS? How do I make sure my website works on mobile, tablet, and desktop?"

**Modifications Made:**
- Used mobile-first approach with `max-width: 768px` breakpoint
- Adjusted grid layouts to single column on mobile
- Made navigation menu collapse into hamburger on mobile
- Adjusted font sizes and padding for smaller screens
- Tested and adjusted spacing for different viewport sizes

## Data Structure

### Prompt 9: JSON Data Structure Design
**Prompt:** "What's a good JSON structure for storing project data that includes name, description, technologies, GitHub URL, and screenshots?"

**Modifications Made:**
- Created comprehensive JSON structure for projects with all required fields
- Added fields for introduction, full description, technologies array, contribution, and URLs
- Created similar structure for blog posts with title, content, author, date, tags, and read time
- Ensured JSON is valid and properly formatted
- Added example data that can be easily updated

## Error Handling

### Prompt 10: Error Handling in Vue Components
**Prompt:** "How do I properly handle errors when fetching data in Vue components? I need to show loading states and error messages to users."

**Modifications Made:**
- Implemented loading state using `ref(true)` that changes to `false` after fetch
- Added error state to catch and display error messages
- Created user-friendly error messages with retry buttons
- Used try-catch blocks around all fetch operations
- Added fallback UI for when data fails to load

## Code Optimization

### Prompt 11: Vue Composition API Best Practices
**Prompt:** "What are the best practices for using Vue 3 Composition API? How should I structure my components and manage state?"

**Modifications Made:**
- Used `<script setup>` syntax for all components
- Organized reactive refs at the top of script sections
- Used computed properties where appropriate
- Implemented proper lifecycle hooks (onMounted)
- Separated concerns by creating focused, single-purpose components

### Prompt 12: Code Refactoring
**Prompt:** "How can I make this Vue component more maintainable and reduce code duplication?"

**Modifications Made:**
- Created reusable card components where possible
- Extracted common styles to global CSS file
- Used CSS variables for consistent theming
- Created utility functions for date formatting
- Standardized component structure across all views
